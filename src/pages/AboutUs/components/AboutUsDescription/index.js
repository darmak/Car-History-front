            The service will allow you to maintain a common database of cars where users can view the history of car maintenance, create a new history element or edit an existing one.
            This will help to avoid fraud when selling a car, such as fraud with mileage, since the history will show when and at what mileage the service was performed.
            It will also help the owner of the car to keep a record of those services and in the future to predict a breakdown or the time of the next service.
